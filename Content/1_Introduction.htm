        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Each list in the excel represent one object definition. The name of the list must match the exact name of the object. Each list is divided to rows, columns and cells:</p>
        <p>The row represents one item (member) – node, beam, plate, support, etc…</p>
        <p>The column represents one property attribute of a member – name, type, colour, shape, etc…</p>
        <p>The cell represents one property value – 3m, layer 1, wall (80), etc …</p>

        </p>
        <p>Cell types:</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Double</span> - A floating point number</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Integer</span> – A number which has a minimum value of 0.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Enum</span> - Ordered listing of all the items in a collection used for data validation. Only allowed values from the list can be inputted.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">String</span> - A sequence of characters, Text.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>All values are considered as a <b>metric unit</b>. For all orientation of loads and coordinate system is valid <b>right-hand rule</b>.</p>
        <p>Each structural entity, that means each member, has got its own local co-ordinate system. This co-ordinate system is a three-dimensional right-handed Cartesian co-ordinate system.</p>
        <p>The system provides for:</p>
        <p>-	unambiguous positioning of the member in space,</p>
        <p>-	unambiguous definition of load and boundary conditions,</p>
        <p>-	unambiguous interpretation of results.</p>
        <p>It may help you to determine the direction of individual structural elements axis, if you remember what you (probably) learnt at school. Take your right hand, position your thumb, index finger and middle finger so that they are perpendicular to each other. Then the following applies (see also the image below):</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>- the thumb points in the direction of the x-axis,</p>
        <p>-	the index finger points in the direction of the y-axis,</p>
        <p>-	the middle finger points in the direction of the z-axis.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>GUIDs – Unique identifier number for each object in the project and the model level. If the IDs are available in project, model and each object could be recognized and tracked for revisions with a third party software. Filling the cells with ID is not mandatory for analytical exchange format.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Note: The order of lists and columns does not matter, for import. Important is to consistently follow its naming.</p>
