        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Each list in the excel represents one object definition. The name of the list must match the exact name of the object. Each list is divided to rows, columns and cells:</p>
        <p>The row represents one item (member) – node, beam, plate, support, etc…</p>
        <p>The column represents one property attribute of a member – name, type, colour, shape, etc…</p>
        <p>The cell represents one property value – 3m, layer 1, wall (80), etc …</p>

        <p>Cell types:</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Double</span> - A floating point number</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Integer</span> – A whole number which has a minimum value of 0.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Enum</span> - Ordered listing of all the items in a collection used for data validation. Only allowed values from the list can be inputted.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">String</span> - A sequence of characters, Text.</p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Note: </p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Any numeric value (Double, Integer) has to be formatted as number in excel sheet.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In SAF, supported are <b>metric units</b> and <b>imperial units</b>. Units are defined in model sheet in excel by user. </p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Note: </p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Units can be optionally displayed in property headers.</p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Unit system used in SAF file is given at <a href="2_Project and model specifications.htm">model</a> sheet page by the user.</p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Values given in SAF format should correspond to predefined values per system unit set. Table of predefined and expected units can be reviewed in <a href="2_Project and model specifications.htm">Project and specification page.</a></p>

        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Note: The order of lists and columns does not matter, for import. Important is to consistently follow its naming.</p>

        <p><b style="font-size: 14pt;">Coordinate systems</b>
        </p>
        <p>For all orientation of loads and coordinate system <b>right-handed rule</b> is valid.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The system provides for:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li> unambiguous positioning of the member in space,</li>
            <li>	unambiguous definition of load and boundary conditions,</li>
            <li>	unambiguous interpretation of results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It may help you to determine the direction of individual structural elements axis, if you remember what you (probably) learnt at school. Take your right hand, position your thumb, index finger and middle finger so that they are perpendicular to each other. Then the following applies (see also the image below):</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/introduction3.png" />
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>the thumb points in the direction of the x-axis,</li>
            <li>the index finger points in the direction of the y-axis,</li>
            <li>the middle finger points in the direction of the z-axis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>LCS&#160;- Local coordinate systems</b>
        </p>
        <p>Each structural entity, meaning each member, has got its own local co-ordinate system. This co-ordinate system is a three-dimensional right-handed Cartesian co-ordinate system.</p>
        <p>Each member has several possibilities of enums, defining the Local Coordinate System (LCS). For further understanding of enums defining the LCS of the <a href="A_Objects/7_StructuralCurveMember.htm">StrucutralCurveMember</a> and <a href="A_Objects/8_StructuralSurfaceMember.htm">StructuralSurfaceMember</a> see following:</p>

                    <p>General vector as LCS <b>"by vector"</b></p>
                    <p>User can set the LCS "by vector" with the vector which is not perpendicular to the centre line of the 1D member. Such a vector is projected to perpendicular as shown in animation below. The user-defined vector is the yellow one. The yellow vector is not in perpendicular plane to the centre line of the member, so blue and yellow vector are not parallel.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Tilt of vector defined by point is a special type of LCS for mesh elements of 2D members. You can define one point in global coordinates and all local x-axis (y-axis) of mesh elements follow this point. It is an analogy to LCS by point for 1D members. This special case is mostly used when you need to add data which are depending on LCS of meshes (e.g. reinforcement, results) and should follow radial layout (Circle slabs, silos, etc…). Example is presented below.</p>
